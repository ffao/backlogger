# backlogger

Bot to keep track of beaten, completed and mastered games in a given year for a specific Discord server.

The bot was never intended to be used anywhere else, so a fair number of things are hardcoded for the server in question.

For complex historical reasons (i.e. the author being a massive fan), the bot also sets its nickname to Sana and has extra commands to send pics and gifs.
